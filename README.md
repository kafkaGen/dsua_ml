Run next commands to reproduce work enviroment:
- python -m venv .venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
- pip install -f requirements.txt

### Task 1
Implementation of this task can be found in the `pytorch_basic.ipynb` file with all explanation. Some additional help function is declared in utils module and configuration file is under the `config.yaml` file.

### Task 2
Implementation of this task can be found in the `denoising.ipynb` file with all explanation. Resulting validation dataset is saved under `denoising_valid_results.csv`.

### Task 3
Review is located in the `Neuromorphic Computation Review.md` file.


Place for improvement:
- this README file can be update and maintained in more structured and detailed way, as for example [here](https://github.com/kafkaGen/Airbus).
- every solution can be deployed with docker container with API, as [here](https://github.com/kafkaGen/panoptic-segmentator)
- add documentation to the base code implementation blocks
- process more literute for signal denoising modeling and validation
- at the denoisng task I produce very raw code style do to lake of time. Perfectrly, keep code clearance as in task 1
